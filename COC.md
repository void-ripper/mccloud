# Code of Conduct

## a brief summary

Our code of conduct works under the assumption of the four virtues.

1. Truth
  + Truth exists by itself, seperate from you.
  + Truth exists independet from its way of discovery.
  + Truth exists independent from attention.
  + Everything that is not true, becomes parasitic, because it has to be kept
    artificially alive, aka increases enthropy.
2. Love
  + Love exists in you.
  + Love creates empathy, because it is your emotional connection to others.
  + Love changes who you are and what you do.
  + Everything emotion that is not Love, will exaust you over time, because it
    disconnects you from who you realy are.
3. Consciousness
  + Consciousness is a passive process and can not be forced.
  + Consciousness is expirienced as a trinity of Knowing, Feeling and Doing.
  + Consciousness is synergy, everytime you have two party of the trinity,
    the thrid one arises by itself.
  + Consciousness is the only thing that is unpredictable and anti-enthropic
    at the same time.
4. The Process of Being itself
  + Nothing does not exist and is an error in perception of the mind.
  + We expirience the Process of existance through Truth, Love and Consciousness.
  + Everything that makes you a less truthfull, authentic, loving, uncreative and unaware person,
    can not be good, because it disconnects you from the Process of Being itself.
  + We experience God through the Process of Being itself.

## A explenation on how to arrive to the four virtues

### Nothing does not exist

Nothing is defined as the absence of everything.
This is falacie of perception, because even if there is nothing

### Truth is your logical connection to the Process of Being

### Love is your emotional connection to the Process of Being

### Consciousness can not be forced
