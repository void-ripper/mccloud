# Code of Conduct

Our code of conduct works under the assumption of the five virtues.

1. **The Process of Being itself**
  + Nothing does not exist and is an error in perception of the mind.
  + We expirience the Process of existance through Truth, Love and Consciousness.
  + Everything that makes you a less truthfull, authentic, loving, uncreative and unaware person,
    can not be good, because it disconnects you from the Process of Being itself.
  + We experience God through the Process of Being itself.

2. **Truth**
  + Truth exists by itself, seperate from you.
  + Truth exists independet from its way of discovery.
  + Truth exists independent from attention.
  + Everything that is not true, becomes parasitic, because it has to be kept
    artificially alive, aka increases enthropy.

3. **Love**
  + Love exists in you.
  + Love creates empathy, because it is your emotional connection to others
    and the Process of Being.
  + Love changes who you are and what you do.
  + Every emotion that is not Love, will exaust you over time, because it
    disconnects you from who you realy are.

5. **Consciousness**
  + Consciousness is a passive process and can not be forced.
    Every force, creates a counter force.
  + Consciousness is expirienced as a trinity of Knowing, Feeling and Doing.
  + Consciousness is synergy, everytime you have two party of the trinity,
    the thrid one arises by itself.
  + Consciousness is one of the few things, that can be unpredictable and anti-enthropic
    at the same time.
  + Consciousness produces awarnes and self-reflection.

6. **Chaos**
  + Because Consciousness is unpredictable and uncalcuable.
    If you make space for true Concsciousness, you have to make space for Chaos.
  + Chaos is like salt in the soup. You always want a little bit, but you never
    want to much or you can throw everything away.
  + Chaos is a hidden savior, because it prevents things from becoming completly dead.
  + Chaos prevents everything from being static, so there can be no perfection.
    Everything truly perfect, has to be always in flow.
  + Learn to surve the Chaos, to nurish Consciousness, Love, Truth and The Process of Being itself.
